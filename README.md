This code is a Python script that implements a simple login authentication and a menu-driven program for managing book files.

The script starts with importing the 'os' module to provide a way to interact with the operating system.

It then enters a loop that prompts the user to enter their username and password for authentication. The valid username and password are hardcoded as "AliasgerB" and "-A1li@sge3939" respectively. The user has three attempts to enter the correct username and password before the program exits.

If the user enters the correct username and password, the program displays a menu of available admin tools. The user can select the tool they want to use by entering the corresponding number.

If the user selects tool 1, they are presented with a sub-menu with options to create a book, remove a book, or remove multiple books. If the user selects 'create a book', they are presented with a sub-sub-menu to choose the type of book to create: an empty book, a book with pages, or edit an existing page. If the user chooses to create a book with pages, they are prompted to enter the book name and then the program creates a folder with that name. The user is then presented with options to create a page, edit a page, read a page, or copy content from a page.

If the user selects 'remove book', they are prompted to enter the name of the book they want to remove. The program then removes the folder with that name.

If the user selects 'remove multiple books', they are prompted to enter the names of the books they want to remove. The program then removes the folders with those names.

If the user selects tool 2, they can view all the books present in the 'files' directory.

The program then loops back to the main menu, and the user can choose to exit by entering 'exit' at the main menu.
